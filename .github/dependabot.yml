Below is an example Dependabot configuration file tailored for your BIRXUO AI project hosted at BIRXUO.VERCEL.APP. In this example, Iâ€™ve assumed your project uses npm (common for Vercel deployments such as Next.js). If your project uses a different package manager (for example, yarn, pip, etc.), just replace `"npm"` with the appropriate value as per the [Dependabot documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file).

```yaml
# Dependabot configuration for BIRXUO AI (BIRXUO.VERCEL.APP)
# This file keeps your dependencies up-to-date by checking for updates on a weekly basis.
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm" # Change to your specific package manager if needed
    directory: "/"           # Location of your package.json (or equivalent manifest)
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"     # How frequently to check for updates
``
